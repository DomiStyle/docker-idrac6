## About

Allows access to the iDRAC 6 console without installing Java or messing with Java Web Start. Java is only run inside of the container and access is provided via web interface or directly with VNC.

Container is based on [baseimage-gui](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui) by [jlesage](https://github.com/jlesage)

# Usage

See the docker-compose [here](https://github.com/DomiStyle/docker-idrac6/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) or use this command:
```
docker run -d \
  -p 5800:5800 \
  -p 5900:5900 \
  -e IDRAC_HOST=idrac1.example.org \
  -e IDRAC_USER=root \
  -e IDRAC_PASSWORD=1234 \
  domistyle/idrac6
```
The web interface will be available on port 5800 while the VNC server can be accessed on 5900. Startup might take a few seconds while the Java libraries are downloaded. You can add a volume on /app if you would like to cache them.

## Usage (with SOCKS)

```
# Start a local port forwarding using SOCKS
ssh -fND 4443 <remote-hostname>
docker run -d \
  -p 5800:5800 \
  -p 5900:5900 \
  -e IDRAC_HOST=idrac1.example.org \
  -e IDRAC_USER=root \
  -e IDRAC_PASSWORD=1234 \
  -e SOCKS_PROXY_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -e SOCKS_PROXY_PORT=4443 \
  domistyle/idrac6
```

NB: `host.docker.internal` only works on Windows and MacOS since Docker 18.03+.

| Path       | Description                                  | Required |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
|`/app`| Libraries downloaded from your iDRAC instance will be stored here. Add a volume to cache those files for a faster container startup. | No |

|`/screenshots`| Screenshots taken from the virtual console can be stored here. | No |

Make sure the container user has read & write permission to these folders on the host. [More info here](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui#usergroup-ids).

## Issues & limitations

* ~Libraries are not loaded correctly~
  * ~Causes error message on start~
  * ~"Pass all keystrokes to server", "Single Cursor" and "Virtual Media" is not available until fixed~
* User preferences can't be saved
* VNC starts with default 1024x768 resolution instead of fullscreen
  * Use "View" -> "Full Screen" to work around this issue
* Keyboard layout can't be changed
* Only one iDRAC server can be accessed with a single instance
  * Run multiple containers to work around this issue (e.g. srv1.idrac.example.org, srv2.idrac.example.org)
